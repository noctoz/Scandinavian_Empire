 sca_event_1_title:0 "Danish Rebellion"
 sca_event_1_desc:0 "The viking kingdoms of the north always remained independent and the Scandinavian empire was kept together through blood and steel. After a trying time plagued by uprising it comes as no surprise when a messenger tells you that the Danish armies are assembling accross the border."
 sca_event_1_opt:0 "To arms!"

 sca_event_3_desc:0 "Our miners have founds an immense deposit of iron in the mountain of Kirunavaara. This will be a significant source of income for the empire for a long long time."
 sca_event_3_opt:0 "To the mines!"
 sca_event_5_desc:0 "History remember the vikings as bands of fierce and independent warriors but every society have to adopt to the world around it. One such adoptation is the reforming of the army and the institution called 'indelningsverk', or military-tenure system. The system was a military organization where the soldiers were given a croft to live on and cultivate (made possible by the reduction), where the harvest served as their wages. Thus the country could maintain a large army in both times of peace and of war. If a peasant assumed the responsibility of maintaining an enlisted rider, his horse and equipment, he was exempted from conscription and freed from paying taxes. The peasants could cooperate in groups of 2-5 farms and maintain a soldier or a sailor. The soldiers were organized into companies of 150 men, and every county should field a regiment of 1200 men. The new system also made no distinction between officers of noble birth and commoners."
 sca_event_6_desc:0 "Vikings are mostly remembered as warriors but they were also very capable farmers. The Scandinavian empire has kept this legacy and made many improvements to agriculture over the years - not the least of which was the great agricultural reform supervised by Rutger MacLean. MacLean was a harsh man, who didn't hesitate to burn down the houses of peasants who refused to move to their assigned lots. But in the end the farmers thanked him, as the new methods and larger fields resulted in more bountiful harvests than ever before."
 sca_event_7_desc:0 "The vikings were always great ship builders but in the 16th century the fleet was given a more organized structure. One of the important ports during this age was Sønderborg, where there was a good supply of oak for shipbuilding. Another important port of this time was Copenhagen, which had gradually become the home of the fleet."
 sca_event_8_desc:0 "While Norwegian peasants have extracted copper and iron for centuries on a small scale there are no great iron or copper mines in these lands. This is contrasted by the thriving mining sector in the Swedish region where great quantities of both metals have been mined, cast, and exported since the Middle Ages.\nThe Crown has recently acquired many pieces of land previously under the control of the Church and Nobility who did not have resources or inclination to search for metals. Let us invite experienced prospectors and miners and see what treasures lie beneath these mountains."
