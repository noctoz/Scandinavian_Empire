# Scandinavian_Empire
EU4 mod that models the continuation of a CK2 Viking Empire

This is best enjoyed on Hard or Very Hard since you start quite powerful

Contains:
- A completely new mission tree
- New national idea group composed from the existing Scandinavian ones
- A Scandinavian Empire where most of the land is owned by vassals
- The western Baltic coast is owned by Pomerania, one of the vassals
- The Baltic area is owned by Estonia, another of the vassals
- Finland has expanded its borders a bit into Russia
- Bonuses to certain key provinces from the CK2 play through that inspired this
- All of Scandinavia as well as Lithuania and Friesland follow the Norse faith
- Jomsviking hold on Shetland for some CK2 viking flavor (and some pretty neat bonuses)
